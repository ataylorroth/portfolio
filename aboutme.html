In middle school, she hated living there because there are no malls and her friends liked to complain about that. Now, however, she loves it there and spends her time at home hiking mountains, camping, and driving out the road to watch beautiful sunsets";

  <h2>School</h2>
  <p>Abigail goes to <a href="https://www.colby.edu/" target="_blank">Colby College</a>, which is a small liberal arts school in Waterville, Maine 
  (upon hearing this, most people ask her why she loves the cold so much). She just finished her sophomore year there, 
   and is a double major in Math and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, with a minor in Computer Science. 
   She is also on the swim team there, although she is currently very out of shape and is dreading getting back in the pool. 
   At Colby she recently started a Women in Math and Computer Science (WiMaCS) club with two of her friends which is a great excuse to buy snacks and hold movie nights!
   Also, she is very proud of the fact that they convinced the math department to buy stickers for them.</p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>In her free time, Abigail enjoys eating Annie's Mac and Cheese (right out of the pot with the wooden spoon), 
    consuming as many Sour Patch Watermelon as possible, mastering the art of hiking in crocs, and fighting the patriarchy.</p>
